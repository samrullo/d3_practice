      selects body DOM element

      counts and parses dataset with data method. everything from this point onwards run number of times the length of dataset
      to create new data-bound elements you must use enter(). This method looks at the current DOM selection, and then at the data 
      being handed to it. if there are more data values than corresponding DOM elements, then enter() creates a new placeholder
      element on which you can work your magic. it then hands off a reference to this new placeholder to the next step in the chain
      append("p") takes the empty placeholder selection created by enter() and appends a p element into DOM. Then it hands off reference
      to the element it just created to the next step in the chain.
      text("some text") takes reference to the newly created p element and inserts a text value
